# Enterprise Attendance (Mock Flutter App)

This repository contains a production-oriented Flutter app skeleton for an AI-powered employee attendance, productivity, chat, and timesheet system.

Quick start

1. Ensure Flutter is installed (stable channel).
2. From the project root run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

What is included

- Clean, modular structure under `lib/src`
- Riverpod for state management
- Mock `ApiService`, `WebSocketService`, and `AIService`
- Screens: Login, Home, Attendance, Work, Chat, Timesheet, Dashboards
- Design system with enterprise theme

Note: This is a client-only mock with server validation points simulated. Server-side authoritative logic must be implemented in a backend for production.
